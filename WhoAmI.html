        <H1>Who Am I ?</H1>
            <p style="margin-top:45px;">
                I am Jake Jung from SouthKorea and I was an automation engineer who uses PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and SCADA <strong>(OT only).</strong> 
                So I don't have any experience of IT industries before I decide to move today. I am learning baby HTML code first. And I made this page to save 
                my earning knowledge, as I am a rookie developer.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:45px;">
                However the PLC engineer also has experience with programming but it's totally different purpose. 
                It is used for equipment, and the size of equipment that used for this industry is big but the process is too small compare with IT.
                So the program made by me for specific equipment is kind of small size always, Which was fully applicable for my tasks if I get 
                information from my customer or schematic drawings or functional descriptions.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:45px;">
                Just imagine that I am 40 years old, and getting older and older in the future. How many years can I stand in this industry for big-equipment?
                The shopfloor of factories kind of dangerous and it doesn't have a good smell for me anymore. That's why I am trying to learn even I am a 
                40's baby and want to store my tries in these places.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:45px;">
                The process will be simple. I will make this primitive page first, with my learning from web-basics. And furthermore, I will make some baby 
                projects on this site. (that will be not a part of portfolio)</p>
