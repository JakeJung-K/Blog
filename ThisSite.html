                This is a basic <u>personal portfolio site</u> that is made on my <Strong>own.</Strong>
                I am a beginner who wants to grow up, I hope this site will helpful for me and <strong>maybe</strong> you too.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:45px;">
                This site includes my portfolio but, <u>I also use it as my own blog</u> because As a beginner, I want to be familiar with the web, 
                and know more knowledge of the front-ends and also back-ends. And I think If I <strong>manage and maintain</strong> this site on my own,
                I will get experience and It may help me.</p>
